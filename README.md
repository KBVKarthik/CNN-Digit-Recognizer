# CNN Digit Recognizer

This GitHub repository contains an implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) digit recognizer. The digit recognizer is trained to accurately classify and recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

## Features

- **Convolutional Neural Network**: The digit recognizer is built using a deep convolutional neural network architecture, specifically designed to effectively capture spatial features of the input digit images.
- **MNIST Dataset**: The model is trained and evaluated using the MNIST dataset, a widely-used benchmark dataset for digit recognition tasks.
- **Preprocessing**: The repository includes preprocessing code to normalize and transform the MNIST dataset, ensuring optimal training and testing conditions for the CNN model.
- **Training and Evaluation**: The model is trained using labeled digit images and evaluated on a separate test set to measure its accuracy and performance.
- **Model Serialization**: The trained model can be saved and loaded using standard serialization techniques, allowing for easy deployment and integration into other applications.
- **Inference**: The repository provides an example script for performing inference on custom digit images using the trained model, allowing users to test the digit recognizer on their own handwritten digits.

## Dependencies

The following dependencies are required to run the code:

- Python 3.6+
